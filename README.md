# [**Introduction**](#introduction)

This is my Android sample app that is built with 100 % Kotlin and Jetpack Compose components. I writes this repository because this is my knowledge & experience from realities that i do everyday. In additional, inspired from [**Android Architecture Samples**](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples), this application is a general combination from many application that i have written. They always have splash screen, home screen, setting screen, menu bottom bar, send notifications daily,... and so forth.
